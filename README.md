🎓 Panjab University RAG Chatbot
An AI-powered chatbot designed to simplify the admission process at Panjab University by providing instant, accurate answers to queries related to eligibility, required documents, deadlines, and application procedures.

This system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by combining:

🔍 Web scraping & indexing with LlamaIndex, LangChain, and ChromaDB

🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating contextual answers

💬 A conversational frontend built with React.js

🚀 A fast and scalable backend using FastAPI

☁️ Deployed via Render, Vercel, or Docker

By converting scattered website content into a searchable knowledge base, the chatbot reduces user confusion and administrative workload. Future versions aim to support queries beyond admissions—covering academics, events, and research—transforming it into a full digital assistant for the university.
